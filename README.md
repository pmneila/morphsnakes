The **Morphological Snakes** are a family of related methods for image-guided
evolution of curves and surfaces represented as a level-set of an embedding
function. They have application in several computer vision areas, such as
tracking and image segmentation.

The first ideas of **Morphological Snakes** were introduced in [2], [1]
completes that work describing the underlying mathematical foundations,
extending the application to the two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases,
and introducing two new algorithms: **Morphological Geodesic Active Contours** and
**Morphological Active Contours Without Edges**.

## Background

The contour evolution methods have been known in the Computer Vision community
for years, perhaps being the **Geodesic Active Contours** and the **Active Contours
without edges** the two most prominent examples. They both try to find a contour
that serves as a boundary to separate the image in two areas (usually called
**foreground** and **background**) based on the contents of the image. Both methods
work by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on an embedding function
that has the contour as its zero-levelset.

The morphological snakes aim to provide a very fast, simple and stable
approximation to the solution of these PDEs. They do so substituting the terms
of the PDE by the repeated application of morphological operators over a binary
embedding function.

The **morphological operators** are defined as translation and contrast-invariant
operators. A morphological operator transforms an input function depending only
on the shape of its levelsets. For example, two very well known morphological
operators are the **dilation** and the **erosion**.

## Brief theoretical description

The PDE for the Geodesic Active Contours (GAC) is

![eq1](examples/eq1.png)

This PDE is the sum of three terms. From left to right, the smoothing term, the
balloon term and the image attachment term. It is well-known that the balloon
term can be solved by the repeated application of a dilation (or erosion)
operator with a small radius. Similarly, it is easy to simulate the image
attachment term with simple binary rules. However, it is not so easy for the
smoothing term.

[1] introduces a new morphological operator, the **curvature operator**, and
proves that it is a very good approximation to the mean curvature flow given by
the smoothing term. With this new operator, [1] also introduces the
**Morphological Geodesic Active Contours** (MorphGAC).

The MorphGAC consists of the approximation to the above PDE of the GAC with
the composition of the dilation, the erosion and the curvature operator.

In a very similar way, the Active Contours without Edges (ACWE) evolves the
embedding function using the PDE

[1] describes the Morphological ACWE (MorphACWE) approximating this PDE with
the dilation, the erosion and the curvature operator.

## Implementation

The code provided is a Python implementation of the Morphological Snakes
methods. It does not aim to be a fast or efficient implementation. Instead, it
is intended to be as brief, understandable and self-contained as possible.

The code is documented and in ``tests.py`` there are some usage examples.
